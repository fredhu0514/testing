You can skip steps, but make sure you have done all the <span style="color:red">[<u>**Required Checkpoint**</u>]</span> items.

### 1 Environment Setup

#### 1.1 Set up the environment

- Install the latest [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) according to your OS (operating system)

  - <span style="color:red">[**<u>Required Checkpoint</u>**] </span>

    - MacOS: Input below bash script in **terminal**.
    - Windows: Input below bash script in **Windows Command Prompt**, **Powershell** or a similar command line tool.
    - Linux: Not a recommended developing platform.

    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```

    You should see a version number for each command. Make sure that `Node >= 14.0.0` and `npm >= 5.6`.

    You should see a version number. Make sure that `git >= 2.30.0`.
I know this one is really hard, but I still have to do it.
